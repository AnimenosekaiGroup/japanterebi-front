         <h4>WELCOME ON JAPAN TEREBI !</h4>
         <p>Japan Terebi give to my family and friends the opportunity to discover Japanese television through the
            website which source code is in the same "repository" (directory/project).</p>
         <p>Japan Terebi ("Japan Terebi", "Japan TV", "Anime no Sekai" "we", "I" or "us") provides our website
            accessible at https://japanterebi.netlify.app (the "Site") through which users can participate in an online
            community dedicated to enjoying anime, japnese channels and media, through streams hosted by other parties
            ("mov3.co" or "mov3" represent the owner of the site "https://mov3.co/ja/" or "https://mov3.co/en/") ("Dテレ"
            or "dsgstng" represent the owner of the site "https://dsgstng.herokuapp.com/"). Please read the following
            important terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") carefully. <br />These Terms of Use and all policies
            referenced in this document or elsewhere on the Site that are incorporated herein by reference govern your
            access to and use of the Site and Services. <br /><br /></p>
         <div style="text-align: center;">YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY USING THE SITE, SERVICES OR BY POSTING ANY CONTENT ON
            THE SITE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE IN
            THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.</div>
         <br />
         <h4>HOW TO WATCH JAPANESE TV?</h4>
         <p>You need to create an account in order to access the service. This account can be created throught the
            "login" page of this website. <u>A one-time use invitation is required in order to create any sort of
               account</u>. This avoids the usage of this service by any person not authorized to and therefore limits
            the usage of this service to the person which I personnally gave an invitation to (friends and family). Once
            logged in, you should be redirected to the main page. Any request to any of the API endpoints is protected
            by a "token" representing your account, stored in the local storage of your computer. This token is verified
            at each request and you can't and should not bypass this system by any mean.</p>
         <br />
         <h4>JAPAN TEREBI'S RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
         <p>This site just lists third party streams and Japan Terebi isn't responsible for the content which is shown
            on this site. <br />The purpose of this site is to help my family and friends discover the Japanese
            television.<br />Accordingly, we are making this site for non-profit only, THIS SITE IS ENTIRELY FREE TO USE
            AND WITHOUT ADVERTISEMENTS.
            <br />
            <h4>PROTECTION OF MINORS</h4>
            <p>To access this service you certify that you have read and are agreeing with these terms of serives and
               that you have at least 16 years old. <br />You should also respect the Film Classification and Rating
               Organization (映画倫理機構, Eiga Rinri Kikō) also known as 'Eirin', decisions on films content Rating.
               <br />Minors under the age of 16 can use this service only under the responsibility of an adult.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>DO I EVEN GET PAYED?</h4>
            <p>I don't get paid for all the time I spent making this site and maintaining it. <br /><br /><strong>
                  Advertisements </strong> <br />As said before, Japan Terebi does NOT earn money by making this site:
               it is for non-profit only.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>OBLIGATIONS FOR JAPAN TEREBI USERS</h4>
            <p>This service, as well as everything presented to you through this website is provided to you in a
               non-commercial personal use only.<br>You agree that you mustn't use the service in any other way that
               describe in these Terms of Services. We remind you that you're totally responsible for the risk you
               encountered while using internet and social networking services (social media).<br>The speed of
               information transmission does not entirely depend on Japan Terebi, and could come from the
               characteristics inherent in electronic communications networks and the technical characteristics of your
               connection and Internet access mode.<br>The content that you publish in the context of the use of Japan
               Terebi whatever the form and the medium, and in particular the information, data, photographs, texts,
               drawings, graphics, images, sounds and videos, are under your sole responsibility and vigilance. You
               agree in particular to ensure that the content thus published is not, but not limited to, illegal,
               harmful, abusive, constituting counterfeiting, harassment, defamatory, abusive, obscene, threatening or
               in any way threatening minors, privacy others or indecent, pornographic, child pornography, constituting
               incitement to the commission of crimes and offenses, provoking discrimination, hatred, racism or violence
               because of origin, sex, religion, apology for Nazism, challenges to the existence of crimes against
               humanity or recognized genocides, false news or unsolicited commercial prospecting.
               <br>You should also be careful not to obstruct or disrupt in any way the Japan Terebi service, the
               servers and the networks connected to the service.
               <br>You acknowledge that you must adopt responsible behavior and watch any content that you publish.
               Japan Terebi cannot be held responsible for the content published by its users.
               <br>In addition, we recommend that you exercise extreme caution when you receive messages inviting you to
               transmit information relating to your account (Japan Terebi won't send you any messages through e-mail).
               These requests can lead to identity theft. I'm at your disposal if you want more information
               (niichannomail@gmail.com).</p>
            <br />
            <h4>MY OBLIGATIONS</h4>
            <p>We will try to ensure that our service is available permanently and continuously but is under no
               obligation of result. Japan Terebi may therefore interrupt its service for reasons of maintenance and
               upgrading without you being able to hold it against it, or invoke any responsibility in its
               regard.<br />I decline all responsibility in the event of a malfunction or interruption of the service
               beyond its control and linked to a human error, a bug, a virus or that a third party, such as a channel
               whose programs we distribute or of mov3.co or Dテレ discontinue their service.<br />I cannot be held
               responsible for any damage that you may suffer under your use of the website if this damage results, in
               whole or in part, from one of your actions or omissions or if this damage is due to a technical
               incompatibility between your equipment and us.<br />I'm not responsible for third-party applications (the
               livestream hoster for instance), hypertext links or advertisements shown on the service because I did not
               put any advertisements by myself.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHERE DOES THE STREAM COME FROM?</h4>
            <p>All of the streams are coming from third party services, such as mov3.co, Dテレ, YouTube, etc. The stream
               sources are automatically searched and checked by a script on my server. All of the stream sources are
               proxied through my server to provide fallbacks, caching and stability (this is the reason why all of the
               streams are coming from https://japanterebi.herokuapp.com and not from the third party hosts directly).
               The stream sources are searched through YouTube's API, IPTV-ORG (https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv), Dテレ
               GraphQL API, Ok.ru, Vk.com, mov3.co.<br>As for the EPG (Electronic Program Guide), the information is
               coming also from various sources like the channel website directly (the API used for the website), JCOM's
               TV Guide service (their API), NHK's API, etc.</p>
            <h4>WHERE IS THE DATA STORED?</h4>
            <p>For the accounts, the thumbnails, the EPG, the profile pictures, the sources they are all stored in a
               MongoDB Atlas instance and on multiple Redis instances.</p>
            <p>The serveless API endpoints are all hosted by Vercel on AWS. The background server workers and stream
               endpoints are hosted on Heroku and the front end is hosted on Netlify. The source code is hosted on
               GitHub.</p>
            <h4>POSSIBILITY OF ACCESSING JAPAN TEREBI's WEBSITE</h4>
            <p>It is possible to access Japan Terebi's worldwidely without any restrictions. Also, because of the way
               the livestreams are managed, it is possible that you could not access a specific livestream at a given
               time, because the livestream is down or a third party decided to discontinue their service. The quality
               of the services provided may differ depending on the terminals and connection methods (3G, 4G, ADSL,
               broadband, Optical Fiber, etc.) applied to the user by his carrier.</p>
